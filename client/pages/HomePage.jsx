      <h1> Warlord of Ravagea </h1>
       <h4> Introduction</h4>
       This game was created as a group project in an edX Full Stack Development Bootcamp. It showcases a variety of technology such as React, JavaScript, Mongoose and Bootstrap. It also showcases a fair amount of case specific items such as Drag and Drop done with only useState, Context data, session storage, password encryption and stripping, and interaction for users to create a deck of cards, get some booster packs, and adjust as they see fit. This project was done in a 1 week time crunch from concept to creation and showcases the desire to think outside the box while pushing further down coding rabbit hole.
       <h4> Game Summary:</h4>
        Warlords of Ravagea is a tactical grid based card game.
       <h4>Inspiration:</h4>
        Magic the Gathering
        Long time running trading card game that is about battling creatures and other summoners. They do a great job at creating a duel giving players both freedom of choice in deck building, endless combinations, and even more options for strategy in doing so.

        Triple Triad: 
        Originally a Mini Game within Final Fantasy VIII there was a lot of inspiration taken from Triple Triad for playing across a board. The board creates another part of the strategy of the game itself and is something that is incorporated in the Warlords of Ravagea.

        <h4>Project Team:</h4>
        This project was done by Stark, Jackson, Samiye and Arthur. When this team was formed we wanted something that would be a bit unique from a typical group project, while also having something we could both be proud of and have fun with!
