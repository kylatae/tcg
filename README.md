## Description

Warlords of Ravagea is a tactical grid based card game inspired by Magic the Gathering and Triple Triad: Originally a Mini Game within Final Fantasy VIII.

This game was created as a group project in an edX Full Stack Development Bootcamp. It showcases a variety of technology such as React, JavaScript, Mongoose and Bootstrap. It also showcases a fair amount of case specific items such as Drag and Drop done with only useState, Context data, session storage, password encryption and stripping, and interaction for users to create a deck of cards, get some booster packs, and adjust as they see fit. This project was done in a 1 week time crunch from concept to creation and showcases the desire to think outside the box while pushing further down coding rabbit hole.
